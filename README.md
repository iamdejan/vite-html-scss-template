# Vite + HTML + SCSS Template

This template will be used for me to learn HTML and CSS. However, I decided to use SCSS due to its additional features, so whenever I am tired with CSS, I can just use SCSS.

## Run

### Prerequisites

Install `pnpm` first before running the project.

### Development (with Hot Reload)

`pnpm run dev`

### Production

`pnpm run preview`
